This is a PowerBI end to end project
I'm thrilled to present my first project, "Ecommerce Sales Dashboard," built using Power BI technology.

Project Highlights:
Developed an interactive dashboard to monitor and analyze online sales data.
Utilized advanced parameters for detailed analysis in worksheets and customized views using filters and slicers.
Established connections, joined new tables, and performed calculations to manipulate data, enabling user-defined parameters for visualizations.
Implemented various customized visualizations, including bar charts, donut charts, clustered bar charts, and slicers.
